# Simple Version Of Reddit

Created a simple version of reddit using 
- React
- Typescript
- Tailwind
- Firebase.

# ERD Structure

I chose Firebase for two main reasons:

- Ease of Setup: Given my time constraints and the requirements of my take-home project, Firebase was the most straightforward option to get up and running quickly.

- Built-in Authentication: Firebase handles authentication, including password hashing, which saved me the trouble of implementing and securing this functionality myself. This allowed me to focus on other aspects of the project.
